# hello-world


My first repository

My name is Darija, and I'm 28 years old programming student.
I'm new to GitHub and programming, and has no experience, so am looking for a help all over the Internet in hope to finish my college project since the 15th of August 2017.

Wish me some luck!! I am sure I'll need it. :)
